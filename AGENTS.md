Use pep8.
Don't use try excepts to quit the program, I want it to crash if something went wrong.
Don't bloat the code with big functions, split them into smaller ones.
Don't bloat the code with unnecessarily long comments, print decoration (columns of # and newlines), and excessive print verbosity.
Do not generate any documentation unless explicitly asked to.
